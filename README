Link::C - Link C libraries into your Perl 6 program
Supports most functions of native types (int, char *, etc.)
No support for structs, but this can be added eventually.
Only works with Rakudo.


USAGE:

use Link::C;
Link::C::link <library_file header.h>;
my $result = C::my_function("arguments", 42);


OPTIONS:  (give to Link::C::link)

:link($match, ...)  (Default: *)
 - Link only functions whose names match $match.
    Useful if you're interested in only a small subset of a large library
	that would take a long time to process.
:skip($match, ...)
 - Do not link functions whose names match $match.
    This overrides :link.
:import($match, ...)
:import($match => $subst, ...)
 - Import functions into global namespace
    By default functions are put into the C:: namespace.  Using this option
    will import the functions whose names match $match, optionally replacing
    those parts of their name with $subst.  You can include namespace
    seperators in the string.  This is mainly so you can say:
     :import(/^SDL_/ => 'SDL::')
    or such, and call SDL::Init instead of C::SDL_Init.
    Using :import(*) will put all functions into the global namespace.
:verbose
 - Print status messages to STDERR for the impatient.
:quiet
 - Disable non-fatal warnings such as when caching fails.
:cache  (Default: True)
 - Cache the linking code.
:!cache
 - Do not cache the linking code.
:cache<always>
 - Use cache even if old.
    Use this if you don't want Link::C to regenerate the linking code every
    time your program is modified.  To force regeneration, delete both cache
    files manually or remove this option.

INSTALLATION:

Copy the Link directory to wherever you keep your perl 6 libraries.


DEPENDENCIES:

perl >= 5.10
readelf
gcc or cpp


NOTES:

Eventually, you will simply be able to say:
 use Link::C <library header.h>;
instead of:
 use Link::C;
 Link::C::link <library header.h>;
but this is not possible until custom imports are specced and implemented.

Due to Rakudo's speed, the first run-through of your program will take a bit of
time to generate and compile the linking code.  However, this code will be
cached at $yourprogram.linkc-cache.pm and $yourprogram.linkc-cache.pir.  Once
cached there will be minimal overhead.  For even shorter load times, do this:
 $ perl6 --target=pir Link/C.pm > Link/C.pir

Right now, Link::C::link can only be called once, because the cache would get
overwritten.  However, you can give all your libraries and headers to Link::C
at once, and it will automatically link each function to the right library.
This will probably be faster than doing it in multiple passes anyway.

Link::C assumes your library files are in ELF format.
